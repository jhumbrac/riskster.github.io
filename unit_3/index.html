	<h1>How to buy property on Mars</h1>
	<h2>What life will be like when the earth becomes uninhabitable for humans</h2>
	

	<p>The outlook for humans on earth looks bad. Climate change, excessive waste, pollution and food shortages are some of the many challenges we face. We are not working fast enough to tackle these challenges. We need to look at other options and see what life will be like in 100 years.</p>

	<h3>Be a first mover!</h3>
	<p>Buying property on Mars has never been cheaper. And with the extreme weather patterns of earth disrupting food production, now has never been a better time to buy. Once you have adapted to lower oxygen levels and extreme isolation you will be sure to enjoy 7% return per year on your investment. </p>

	<h3>Make a plan</h3>
	<p>Decide on what is important to you then build a strategy. For most of this is about survival followed by schools and a great neighbourhood. Once you have made a list you will know where to compromise so you can make a quick decision or move to another option.</p>

	<h3>Get finance ready</h3>
	<p>You will have more negotiation power if you have a pre-approved mortgage. The current relocation fee for the colony on Mars was around 160 billion dollars. Speak to you bank manager and create a saving plan for any additional money your require. </p>
